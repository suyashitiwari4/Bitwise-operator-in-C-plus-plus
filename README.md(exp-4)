EXP-4
AIM: to study about bitwise operator.
APPARATUS:Online C++ compiler.
THEORY:
     & =	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
    |	=Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	
    ^ =	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	
    ~ =	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	
    << = 	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
    >> = Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	
  CONCLUSION:
       Hence we have learned about the bitwise operator in C++.
